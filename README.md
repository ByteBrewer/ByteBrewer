## Projects

### Evaluating surgical performance using reinforcement learning (2022)

In this project, we are looking to the capability of AI to score surgical performance, which replaces the manual scoring from experts.

### System and method for monitoring occupants within a vehicle using a plurality of convolutional nerual network (2021)

This Project aims to develop a classification model to detect proper, imporper, and non-use of the seatbelt in vehicles through vision processing thereby using deep learning

### Ergonomics assessment for workers' safe (2020)

This project aims to establish a workflow to assess the workers' injury risk on the top of the automation that estimates their pose.
